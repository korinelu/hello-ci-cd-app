# CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions & Docker

## 1. Introduction
This project demonstrates the implementation of a complete Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions and Docker. It automates the process of building, testing, pushing, and deploying a simple web application to a cloud-hosted virtual machine, enabling faster and more reliable software delivery.

## 2. Abstract
The goal was to set up a lightweight yet functional CI/CD system without relying on any paid cloud CI tools. A simple HTML web application was used, and the pipeline automates the following steps:
- Docker image build on code push
- Push to Docker Hub
- Remote deployment to an Azure VM

This project helps simulate real-world DevOps scenarios, focusing on containerized app deployment with version control and automation pipelines.

## 3. Tools & Technologies Used
| Tool           | Purpose                                      |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| GitHub Actions | CI/CD orchestration                          |
| Docker         | Containerization of the application          |
| Docker Hub     | Container registry                           |
| Azure VM       | Hosting and deploying the application        |
| NGINX          | Web server for serving the HTML file         |
| Git            | Version control and GitHub integration       |

## 4. Steps Involved in Building the Project

1. **Folder Structure Setup**

hello-ci-cd-app/ â”œâ”€â”€ app/ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ index.html â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile â”œâ”€â”€ .github/ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ workflows/ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ci-cd.yml â””â”€â”€ README.md


2. **Dockerfile**
- Based on `nginx:alpine`, this serves a static HTML file located in `/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html`.

3. **CI/CD Workflow (ci-cd.yml)**
- Triggered on push to `main` branch.
- Steps:
  - Checkout code
  - Build Docker image
  - Push to Docker Hub
  - SSH into Azure VM and deploy the container

4. **GitHub Secrets Configured**
- `DOCKER_USERNAME`, `DOCKER_PASSWORD`
- `AZURE_VM_IP`, `AZURE_VM_USER`, `AZURE_VM_PASSWORD`

5. **Azure VM Configuration**
- Docker installed and running
- Port 80 allowed in the Network Security Group
- Automated deployment using `appleboy/ssh-action`

## 5. Conclusion
This project successfully implements an end-to-end automated pipeline for deploying a containerized web application using GitHub Actions and Docker. The use of GitHub Secrets ensured secure handling of credentials. With this setup, every change to the `main` branch results in a live deployment â€” demonstrating the power of DevOps automation in real-world environments.

The live application displayed the message:
> ðŸš€ Hello World!  
> This site is deployed using GitHub Actions and Docker on Azure VM.
